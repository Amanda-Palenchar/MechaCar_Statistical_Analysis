## Summary of Statistical Outcomes

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG: 
Based on the outputs of a multiple linear regression model (image below), the following can be concluded: 
- There is a medium/strong correlation between data collected (vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD) and MPGs of the MechaCar. The R squared value is 0.68 with greater than 0.7 signifying a strong correlation and less than 0.7 signifying a medium correlation.
- The two variables impacting MPGs the most are vehicle length and ground clearance due to their low p-values (<0.05).

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:

In comparing the PSI that each vehicle's suspension coils could handle, it is clear that there is the most variability from Lot 3 of the manufacturing plant. The variance of both lot 1 and 2 is less than 0.5% of the mean PSI. Whereas, the variability in lot 3 is over 11% of the mean PSI. 

Additionally, the mean and median PSI of lot 3 is slightly lower than lot 1, lot 2, and the total of the lots. This indicates that the data for lot 3 is skewed slightly left and may have a few suspension coils that are measuring at less than the ~1500 PSI (mean and median) of the other two lots.
